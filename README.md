# Cryptography
# Python program to securely store a secret that it can only be recovered with a password
For optimal usage of the prgram, create a directory eg. “encryption_project”, then create two sub directories eg. “src”, and “data”. The program’s python files i.e. “encrypt.py” and “decrypt.py” is stored inthe sub directory “src”. When the “encypt.py” is executed, the program runs i.e encryption and the respective output files of the program is saved in the “data” sub directory. Again, when the “decrypt.py” program is executed the files stored in the “data” sub directory is used to decrypt.
